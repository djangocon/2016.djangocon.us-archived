        <h2>Selection Process</h2>
<p>The deadline for submissions was <a href="http://time.is/compare/000_19_Apr_2016_in_Anywhere_on_Earth">April 18</a>. Everyone who submitted a proposal has been notified of whether their proposal was accepted. </p>
<p>We chose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and interesting program for our attendees. Check out our <a href="../schedule/tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a> and <a href="../schedule/general-sessions/index.html">talks</a>! </p>
<!-- ## We Want You!

We don't just want to hear from the experts or famous names - other perspectives are just as valuable, so don't let the idea that you're not expert or famous enough stop you because it won't stop us from selecting your talk or the audience from enjoying it. If you've done something that you think other people might be interested in, or that you think they should know about, please tell us about it! 

**We especially want proposals from people who reflect the diversity of our community.** Our community is made better by a diverse set of voices, perspectives and opinions. We'd love to have an intersectional and diverse group of speakers. Please submit your proposals today, and ask people you think might not normally submit to, or be represented at, a tech conference to submit as well! We can't wait to hear from you.

If you haven't spoken at a conference before, this is your invitation to do so. We want to be remembered as the conference where you started your superstar speaking career! -->

<!-- Here is an example talk proposal, along with the talks from the last several years, so you can get an idea of what we’re looking for. Don’t let these examples limit you, however!

- [Example DjangoCon talk proposal: SpacePug](https://2016.djangocon.us/speaking/proposal_advice/)
- [DjangoCon 2015 Talks](https://2015.djangocon.us/schedule/general-sessions/) 
- [DjangoCon 2014 Talks](http://2014.djangocon.us/schedule/)
- [DjangoCon 2013 Talks](https://web.archive.org/web/20131101092915id_/http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/)
- [DjangoCon 2012 Talks](https://web.archive.org/web/20121112040401id_/http://www.djangocon.us/schedule)

The preferred length for talks is 20 to 25 minutes or 40 to 45 minutes, but proposals requiring 45 minutes will be reviewed more stringently.

You should budget at least five minutes for questions; for example, a 25 minute talk will be 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of questions. Audience questions are optional and completely up to the speaker's preference. -->

<h2>Slide Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Keynote, PowerPoint, Open Office, or Google Presentations for your slides.</li>
<li>Use 4:3 for your slide size (it’s the size of Wharton’s projectors). </li>
<li>Minimal slides are best—avoid walls of text and long lists of bullets.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the colors you use. Aim for high contrast slides, avoiding colors that may be difficult to see for those with colorblindness. (You can <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">check your contrast online</a>; you just need the hex codes for your colors!)</li>
<li>Light background with dark text is easiest to read; be mindful that the projector is white. </li>
<li>Make text as large as possible, at least 68pt.</li>
<li>Choose fonts with adequate spacing between letters, and avoid thin or cursive fonts.</li>
<li>Leave the bottom ⅓ of your slides free of text to ensure nothing is obscured.</li>
<li>Avoid or limit the use of flashing videos or animations/animated gifs, as these may have negative effects for people with seizure disorders, migraines, or ADD/ADHD. </li>
<li>Be careful with memes, images, and GIFs, and make sure they are appropriate for a professional audience. </li>
<li>Your talk should lose nothing if the slides aren’t visible. Generally describe graphs, images, and other information for the audience.</li>
<li>Consider including your Twitter handle on your opening and closing slides! </li>
<li>Consider publishing your slides after your talk (on the platform of your choice) and tweeting the link with the #djangocon hashtag. </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/speak">AlterConf</a> for their amazing speaking recommendations! </p>

<h2>Speakers Eat Free!</h2>
<p>All speakers and tutorial presenters will receive free tickets to DjangoCon. </p>
<!-- ## Submitting a Proposal

Just [log in or create an account](/dashboard) and get started! There's a proposal form for talks and a proposal form for tutorials and demonstrations. Take a look at them - they'll make it clearer how this works.

Don't agonize over your proposal. Just get it in. We'll get back to you if anything's not clear.
Don't hesitate to submit more than one proposal either.

**The deadline for submissions is [April 18](http://time.is/compare/000_19_Apr_2016_in_Anywhere_on_Earth).** We'll let you know if your talk is accepted by May 16. -->

<h2>Speaker Mentors</h2>
<p>Speaking in front of a large audience doesn't come easily to many people. Our conference audiences are full of interesting people with interesting things to say, but who remain in the audience because for whatever reason, they didn't feel confident enough to submit a talk proposal.</p>
<p>If you'd like any help in proposing, preparing or presenting your talk, whoever you are and whatever kind of help you'd find useful, feel free to contact one of our speaker mentors! A speaker mentor is an experienced speaker who has volunteered to help other speakers. For first-time speakers, non-native English speakers, unconfident or uncertain speakers or simply anyone who'd like some help with a talk, here are some people who'd like to help you. You'll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several. </p>
<p>And if you'd like to be a speaker mentor, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#3c54595050537c58565d525b535f535212494f">let us know</a>!</p>

<!-- ## Tutorials

We're open to all kinds of ideas, especially ones we haven't thought of!

If you are interested in sample proposals, here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last few years:

<h2>Recording</h2>
<p>Every session at DjangoCon US will have professionally-produced video recordings published to our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to have your talk recorded, please note this in your submission. Doing so will not influence the selection process in any way.</p>
<h2>Lightning talks</h2>
<p>Lightning talks are talks under 5 minutes with or without slides on any topic you want! Anything goes, as long as you can keep it under 5 minutes. Sign-ups will happen at the conference.</p>
