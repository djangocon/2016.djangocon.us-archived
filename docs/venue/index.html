        <h2>Jon M. Huntsman Hall, The Wharton School</h2>
<h3>3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104</h3>
<p><strong>Welcome to Philadelphia, the city of siblingly love!</strong></p>
<p>DjangoCon will be situated on University of Pennsylvania’s campus in the heart of The Wharton School, Huntsman Hall. Huntsman Hall boasts a number of updated classrooms including a state-of-the-art Cisco telepresence connected classroom as well as a unique view of the city from the 8th floor. Huntsman Hall is also home to Wharton’s Business Radio which is hosted live from the Sirius XM studios that are right in the building.</p>
<p>The forum level is spacious and perfect for networking between sessions and meeting up with people for activities. Want to stretch your legs and give your brain a break? Step right out onto Locust walk and follow the brick road for a self-driven tour of our breath-taking campus, or visit Koo Plaza, a beautiful second floor outdoor cafe space, right in Huntsman Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Venue Specific Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Huntsman Hall is entirely accessible by way of ramps, including presentation areas. This includes the parking area and main auditorium. Automatic doors are at all building entrances.</li>
<li>Bathrooms include grab bars, lowered sinks, and lowered urinals.</li>
<li>Three sets of unlocked elevators available during open building hours.</li>
<li>Service animals welcome, with a grassy outdoor plaza off the second floor (Koo Plaza).</li>

<h2>Philadelphia is amazing!</h2>
<p>Philly has fantastic food, from the classic cheesesteak to Chinese food that Anthony Bourdain called "the best Sichuan style Chinese food outside of China." It's chock full of American history, but also the history of computing. Its museums are vibrant and world-class, and the whole city is wonderfully walkable. To plan the non-conference parts of your trip, check out our <a href="../philadelphia.1.html">guide to Philadelphia</a>! </p>
<h2>General Accessibility</h2>
<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.septa.org/fares/pass/transpass.html">SEPTA sells a weekly TransPass</a> which will give you unlimited use of buses, trolleys, and subways, which will get you anywhere you need to go in the city proper for $24 per week.

<h3>Quiet Room</h3>
<p>We will have a clearly marked quiet room (F-36 on Monday-Friday; F-55 on Sunday afternoon) available from Sunday afternoon through Friday evening. This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socializing. </p>
<h3>Lactation Room</h3>
<p>There's a quiet, window-free room in the data center, but it's only accessible with a Wharton badge. Please see the registration desk if you'd like access to this room. </p>
<h3>Restrooms</h3>

<h3>Recovery/Meetings</h3>
<p>There are several meetings near Wharton that are welcoming to newcomers. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.aasepia.org/locations/1904-walnut-street-center-city-pa-19103/">Sunrise Semester</a></strong>: 7:15am Mon - Fri, and many others. 1904 Walnut Street. A 20-minute walk from the venue, or 5-10 minute bus ride on SEPTA Bus #21.  This meeting is the farthest from the venue, but it is the most diverse meeting. There are a fair amount of people in the tech industry who attend. All meetings listed here are welcoming to out-of-town guests, but Sunrise goes above and beyond to welcome out-of-towners with breakfast invites and such.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.aasepia.org/locations/3637-chestnut-street-university-city-pa-19104/">Salerno Beachhead</a></strong>: 12:15pm Mon - Fri. 3637 Chestnut Street. One block from venue. </li>
